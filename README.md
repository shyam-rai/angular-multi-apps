# About

This is a sample project for composing an Angular app with sub applications. [Original tutorial is written by Jeffrey Houser on Medium.](https://medium.com/disney-streaming/combining-multiple-angular-applications-into-a-single-one-e87d530d6527)

## Development

To run the main (container) application, navigate to the root directory and then run `ng serve`.
The `app` will be available on `http://localhost:4200/` and it will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To run the sub app, stay in the root directory and run `ng serve sub-app1` or `ng serve sub-app2`.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.
